Instructions:

    1. Activate the Anaconda or virtualenv environment created
       previously.
       
    2. Resolve subset/config inconsistencies*
       
    3. Execute the shell script from the submission root directory.
        - bash main.sh
        
    4. Find the model weights and training and validation metrics
       in the data/<config>/ subfolder
       
    5. View training and validation metrics via tensorboard.
        - cd data/<config> && tensorboard --logdir=tensorboard
        
* Several of our experiment depend on there existing a minimum number
  of samples per class. We set this via the following config parameters.
  
  - n_classes: <int>
  - sample:
        - size: <int>
        - balanced: <bool>
        
  If sample.balanced is True, we draw (sample.size // num_classes) samples 
  per class. If this number exceeds the representation of any class in the
  data, we sample with replacement.
  
  If sample.balanced is False, we draw sample.size samples without accounting
  for class.
  
  A valid sample size must be defined w.r.t. the class ratio if we expect
  meaningful train/val metrics during training (data leak).
